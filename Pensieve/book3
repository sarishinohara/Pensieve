    I still don't like your tone, boy. If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I'd write to them if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy's case.

Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth...

And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.

Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK!
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.

Ron Weasley: Yeah, it will. You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.
Hermione: Oh, Ron!

Harry Potter: Right, you've got a sort of wonky cross… That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering', sorry about that, but there's a thing that could be the sun … hang on … that means 'great happiness' … so you're going to suffer but be very happy about it...…

Uncle Vernon: What’s that? If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another--
Harry Potter: It’s not. It’s a letter from my godfather.
Uncle Vernon: Godfather? You haven’t got a godfather!
