"No, I thought not. You have not asked me for instance, what is my favorite jam, to check that I am not an impostor. For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to find out my own jam preferences before impersonating myself."

Oh, come on, Harry, it's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.

The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're working from within to bring down the Ministry of Magic with a combination of dark magic and gum disease.

'Oh, hello Harry,' said Luna. 'Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?'

But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.
%
Harry looked around; there was Ginny running towards him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.
%
And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world... had left Harry.
%
Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.
%
Harry Potter: There are bodies in here!
Albus Dumbledore: Yes, but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.
Harry Potter: At the moment?
Albus Dumbledore: Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us. There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to fear from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. 
%
Severus Snape: Do you remember me telling you we were practicising non-verbal spells, Potter?
Harry Potter: Yes.
Snape: Yes, Sir.
Potter: There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor. 
%
Phineas Nigellus: I can't see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore: I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas. 
%
Severus Snape: ...and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, are transparent.
Ron Weasley: Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart! When we come face to face with one down a dark alley we're going to be having a shufti to see if it's solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, "Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?"

Prime Minister: But for heaven's sake, you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out... well... anything!
Cornelius Fudge: The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.

Mrs. Weasley: Promise me you'll look after yourself ... stay out of trouble...
Harry Potter: I always do, Mrs. Weasley, I like a quiet life, you know me.

Harry Potter: What did you have to imitate her [Hermione] for?
Ron Weasley: She laughed at my moustache!
Harry Potter: So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

Mrs. Weasley: Arthur, is that you?
Mr. Weasley: Yes. But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!
Mrs. Weasley: Oh, honestly...
Mr. Weasley: Molly!
Mrs. Weasley: All right, all right... What is your dearest ambition?
Mr. Weasley: To find out how aeroplanes stay up.
[Mrs. Weasley goes to open the door]
Mr. Weasley: Molly! I've got to ask you your question first!
Mrs. Weasley: Arthur, really, this is just silly...

Mrs. Weasley: [whisper] Mollywobbles.

[After seeing a memory of Dumbledore's first encounter with the 11-year old Voldemort]
Harry Potter: Did you know then, sir?
Albus Dumbledore: Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?

Harry Potter: He accused me of being Dumbledore's man through and through.
Albus Dumbledore: How very rude of him.
Harry Potter: I told him I was.
Albus Dumbledore: I am very touched, Harry.

Ginny Weasley: Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.
Harry Potter: What did you tell her?

Harry Potter: Thanks, and what did you tell her Ron's got?
Ginny Weasley: A Pygmy Puff, but I didn't say where.

Narrator: Harry looked around; there was Ginny running towards him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him.

Professor Trelawney: Everything went pitch-black and the next thing I knew I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!

Mrs. Weasley: [Talking about Bill after being bitten by Greyback] Of course, it doesn't matter how he looks...It's not r-really important... but he was a very handsome little b-boy... always very handsome... and he was g-going to be married!

Hermione Granger: She's going to ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book, anyway? Harry Potter: It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione.

Harry Potter: But if I keep popping in and out of the Ministry, won't it look like I approve of what they're doing? Rufus Scrimgeour: It would give everyone a boost to think that- Harry Potter: No, sorry. I don't think that will work. I don't like some of the things the Ministry are doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for one. Rufus Scrimgeour: I would not expect you to understand. These are dangerous times. You are sixteen years old- Harry Potter: Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be locked up either. You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you're trying to make me a mascot! Later. Rufus Scrimgeour: I see. You prefer - like your hero Dumbledore - to disassociate yourself from the Ministry. Harry Potter: I don't want to be used. Rufus Scrimgeour: Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry! Harry Potter: Yeah, and others might say it's your duty to check people actually are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison! You're doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you?! Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered under their noses, or we've got you, putting the wrong people in prison and pretending you've got the Chosen One working for you! Rufus Scrimgeour: So you're not the Chosen One? Harry Potter: I thought you said it didn't matter either way. Rufus Scrimgeour: I shouldn't have said that. It was careless. It was- Harry Potter: No, it was honest. One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care if I live or die, but you do care I convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister... Narrator: Harry raised his right hand and showed the words, shining white, that Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own hand: I must not tell lies. Harry Potter: I don't remember you coming to my aid when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back! The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year!

Ron Weasley: So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him? Harry Potter: If you ask that once more, I'm going to stick this sprout --

Hepzibah Smith: How do I look? Hokey the house-elf: Lovely, madam Narrator: Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey's contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. 
%
Narcissa Malfoy: I see that being Dumbledore's favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won't always be there to protect you. Harry Potter: Wow...look at that...he's not here now! So why don't you have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!
